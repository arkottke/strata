<h1 align="center">Strata Help Manual<br /><small>by Albert Kottke</small></h1>

<p>The manual for Strata is separated into two parts.  The first part is a pdf
document, referred as the <em>technical manual</em>, that describes the theory
and methodology of Strata.  This document can be installed during the Strata
install.  The second part is this html help manual that is directed towards the
interaction with the Strata interface.  This help manual is separated into
sections depending on the currently active interface.  Each interface is
further broken down into the various groupboxes with the purpose of each member
described.  The following are for the input tab:
