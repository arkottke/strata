	<dl>
		<dt>Title</dt>
		<dd>The title is included header of all output files.</dd>
		<dt>Notes</dt> 
		<dd>The notes are only meant to help maintain one's sanity and are not used in any way.</dd>
		<dt>Filename prefix</dt>
		<dd>The filename prefix is prepended onto the standard filenames.  Allowing for
		the filenames to be descriptive of the calculation.</dd>
		<dt>Units</dt>
		<dd>The units system changes the units of both the input and output between Metric and
		English. Changing the units system does not provide conversion between the two different systems.</dd>
		<dt>Save motion data within the input file check box</dt>
		<dd>When this check box is checked, the
		time-series data is included in the data file. This increases the size of the file, but allows for
		the file to be easily transfered.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3><a name="type of analysis">Type of Analysis</a></h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Calculation Method<dt>
		<dd> The calculation method switches between the time-domain and random
		vibration theory methods.</dd>
		<dt>Vary the properties check box<dt>
		<dd> Allows the user to vary the properties of the site.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3><a name="site property variation">Site Property Variation</a></h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Number of realizations<dt>
		<dd> The number of sites profiles that are generated.  For each site
		profile all of the motions are propagated through the site.</dd>
		<dt>Vary the non-linear soil properties check box<dt>
		<dd> Determines whether or not the non-linear soil properties
		(shear-modulus reduction and damping curves) are varied.</dd>
		<dt>Vary the site profile<dt>
		<dd> Determines whether or not the site profile (shear-wave velocity,
		layer thickness, and depth to bedrock) are varied.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h3><a name="equivalent linear parameters">Equivalent Linear Parameters</a></h3>
	<p>Strata performs equivalent-linear site response analysis which assumes
	linear-elastic wave propagation with strain compatible properities.  The
	analysis is an iterative procedure which changes the properties in the
	layer such that properties use the previously computed effective strain for
	the layer.
	<dl>
		<dt>Effective strain ratio<dt>
		<dd>The effective strain ratio rates the maximum strain in the layer to
		the effective strain used for the equivalent non-linear soil
		properties. [Default value 0.65]</dd>
		<dt>Error tolerance<dt>
		<dd>The error tolerance is one of the exit conditions in the
		equivalent-linear site response loop.  Once the error in both the
		damping and shear-modulus in all layers is below this level the
		iterative portion of the analysis stops. [Default value 1%]</dd>
		<dt>Maximum number of iterations<dt>
		<dd>The maximum number of iteration is the other exit conditions for
		the equivalent-linear site response loop.  After reaching this number
		of iterations, the loop exits and a warning message is printed. [Default value 8]</dd>
	</dl>
	</p>
	<h3><a name="layer discretization">Layer Discretization</a></h3>
	<p>Strata allows for variation of the layering thickness and shear-wave
	velocity therefore it divides the velocity layers into sub-layers for the
	wave propagation.  The thickness of these sublayers is controlled by the
	maximum frequency and wavelength fraction. See technical manual for more
	information.
	<dl>
		<dt>Maximum frequency</dt>
		<dd>Maximum frequency of engineering interest. [Default value 20]</dd>
		<dt>Wavelength fraction<dt>
		<dd>The number of wavelengths contained within a sublayer. Typically
		ranges from 1/5 to 1/10, values less than 1/3 are not recommended.
		[Default value 0.2]</dd>
