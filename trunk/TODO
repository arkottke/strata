Next release
-- Remember the informaton regarding the axis for each of the outputs
-- include USGS and CSMIP formats in the auto-recognized file types
-- Added toHtml() for added features, fix report generation
-- Ability to ask for output at the top of each velocity layer
-- Add the ability to directly compute the transfer function
-- Need to adjust the time series output to reflect the maximum frequency.
--  Migrate from QGridLayout to QFormLayout

-- Implement singletons for:
    -- random number generator
	-- Change variation controls to singletons
-- Double corner frequency point source model

Future releases
-- define frequency range of the FAS -- does the default range need to have more resolution
-- Multiple core support
-- Add settings object to remember plot format for types of plots.
-- Time vector for recorded motions should be updated with maximum frequency?

Possibilities
-- Use tree layout for output data
	-> each site is its own branch
	-> each motion is its own branch
-- ability to vary RVT source
-- develop validation files to check the program after each release
-- Ability to create a "report" of the output
-- See if inheritence would improve simplicity of Output class
-- Ability to output time series as AT2 files
-- Ability to read FAS from a file
-- Change help page depending on the state of the program.
-- enable distribution of the shear-wave velocity to be varied Uniform,
Normal, Log-Normal
-- add the option of providing calculation of time series for the RVT site
response. The time series would be computed with the phase angles from a
selected motion.
-- better algorithm for searching for nearest curves

Manual:
	-- discussion of the epistemic versus aleatory variation of the layering
