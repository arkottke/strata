Soil Profile Page
    -- enable distribution of the shear-wave velocity to be varied Uniform, Normal, Log-Normal

Add settings object to remember plot format for types of plots.

RVT
    - check the extrapolated slope at low frequencies -- should be 2:1 because
      of the omega squared relationship
    - look at implications of extrapolation during the inversion and
      calculation of the response
    - add the option of providing calculation of time series for the RVT site
      response. The time series would be computed with the phase angles from a
      selected motion.

Output
    -- better algorithm for searching for nearest curves
    -- allow for outputting of the maximum error profile.
