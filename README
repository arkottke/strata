!! These are the Windows Development Environment install instructions for working with the Strata code  !!
!! for the actual library versions check the strataconfig.pri file                                      !!    

(see https://github.com/Peershares/Peershares/wiki/Windows for help)

1.
install i686-4.8.2-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev3.7z (MinGW 4.8.2)
! 
download mingw-get-setup, in order to add msys to this distribution
installation manager -> All packages -> MSYS -> mark the following for installation:
msys-base-bin
Installation -> Apply changes
!

2.
install qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw482-4.8.6-1(this is Qt 4.8.6; qt creator will need to be installed manually, it is not included in the package)

3.
Start Qt creator and (via manage kit) add the compiler (g++) and the debugger (gdb) from the previous install directories.

4.
Extract qwt-6.X.zip. You should now be able to build this Qt-project without any difficulties.
Build debug and release (after setting the configurations).

5.
Install GetGnuWin32-0.6.3.exe
!
first download.bat
then install.bat
(files do not need to be copied to another folder)
! 

6.
Extract fftw-3.X.zip and build it with MSYS/MinGW
!
in msys, goto /c/path/to/fftw
./configure --with-our-malloc16 --with-windows-f77-mangling --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-threads --with-combined-threads --enable-portable-binary --enable-sse2 --with-incoming-stack-boundary=2
make
!

7.
Install boost 1.5X (http://www.boost.org)
The boost libraries need to be build with the same compiler and runtime as all other components (MSYS/MinGW).
!
Add MinGW 4.8.2 to PATH variabele
bootstrap mingw
b2 toolset=gcc link=shared -j 7
!

8.
Extract or check out strata-r399_werkt.zip and open in Qt creator. 
Make configuration for debug/release.
Configure the pri-file for your build environment (point to the libraries you've just created, MinGW, gnuwin32, boost, etc.).

A.
In order to have the application work, you will need to copy some files to the output directories.
The path settings on windows are not allways correct given MinGW/MSYS/QT/etc.

Copy the following files to the output dir of the build process (build/release):

libgsl.dll, libgslcblias.dll, libm5.dll -> from gnuwin32/bin map to build output
libfftw3-3.dll -> from fftw directory to build output
qwtd.dll, qwtmathmld.dll (in case of release, files not ending with d) -> from qwt/lib directory to build output
QtCored4.dll, QtGuid4.dll, QtNetworkd4.dll, QtScriptd4.dll, QtXmld4.dll (in case of release, files not ending with d) -> from qt/4.8.6/bin directory to build output
libboost_system-mgw47-mt-d-1_55, libboost_serialization-mgw47-mt-d-1_55 (in case of release, files not containing -d- at end before -1_55) -> from boost/stage/lib (or where you put the dll's) to build output

B.
Finally you can install Nullsoft Installer System (nsis-3.0b-setup.exe) to build the strata installers.
Check the paths in the .nsi files, in order to point to the correct files on your system.
Compile the script to generate the installers.
